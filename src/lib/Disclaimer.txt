<p><span class="text-ctp-red">Disclaimer:</span> Most of these wallpapers are sourced from many, many, many sources on the internet. Except a few, I did not make any of these, although I have edited several of them a little bit and use lutgen to convert them from their normal versions to the catppuccin-mocha colour scheme. Zero credit belongs to me in that regard, I'm simply the collector. If you are the artist of one of these wallpapers, please <span class="font-bold">contact me</span> via raising an issue on this <a href="https://github.com/abhishekpaul724/catppuccin-mocha-wallpapers" class="underline">repository</a>, I will happily take the wallpaper down or add credit in this website.</p>
